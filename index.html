            <h2>Brief</h2>
            We decided to see if we could make a small program to help our cohort study for the upcoming end of Mod exam. The idea was to see if we could put some of the skills we've learned over the past 5 weeks into practice. We chose to make this project in Python and to run in the terminal as that seemed the most straightforward platform for everyone to use.

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            In planning out this project, we had to decide how we were going to store and access the information that would form the question bank to test people. We discussed using lists, creating a class to save infomation to variables, and using dictionaries. Due to the constraints of not knowing how to make a project live and create a live database, we settled on using a list of dictionaries. This would give us the option to have many dictionaries in one place, and the flexability of assigning callable keys with a question specific information held within their values.

                <h2>Coding</h2>
                In coding our project we found a couple of problems on our way. Firstly, we had tried to break our code up into manageabnle chunks. In doing this we jumped striaght into coding. In hindsight we should have planned out what we wanted to do in sudo code, and then split it into working parts. We did work together and thrash out a solution, but this step could have made the process run more smoothly. Secondly, we realised that having all our question bank in the same doc would lead to a huge amount of code all in one place. To counter this, we opted to split our code into seperate documents and import those files for use in the program.

            <h2>Using AI</h2>
            One problem with this whole project is that it would have required a lot of work to create the question bank. Thankfully we figured out that we could ask CHat GPT to create multiple choice questions on which ever topic we wanted to practice. We also learned that, by feeding it the structure (some sample questions) that we wanted to follow, it could formatt the questions into dictionaries so that we could quickly create a question bank for the quiz game.

                <h2>What I'd change</h2>
                If re-doing this project, We'd plan this out on paper before starting. We'd also like to implement aditional features and split the question bank into different topics in different files. this would allow us to have some code to select the topic to be quizzed on. I think this would make this program a more complimentary learning tool going forward on this course.
